Current CLI required commands:
  [OK] get-current-user
  [OK] list-events
  [OK] list-events-with-invitees
  [OK] get-event
  [OK] cancel-event
  [OK] list-event-invitees
  [OK] list-organization-memberships

Generated OpenAPI CLI expected equivalents:
  [OK] users get-user-account
  [OK] scheduled-events get-events
  [OK] scheduled-events get-uuid
  [OK] scheduled-events get
  [OK] organizations get-memberships

Compat wrapper command parity (legacy surface):
  [OK] get-current-user
  [OK] list-events
  [OK] list-events-with-invitees
  [OK] get-event
  [OK] cancel-event
  [OK] list-event-invitees
  [OK] list-organization-memberships

Compatibility notes:
  - list-events-with-invitees is emulated via N+1 calls (event list + per-event invitees)
  - cancel-event currently delegates to legacy CLI for behavior parity

Structural parity check: PASS
Default switch recommendation: READY_FOR_EXPERIMENTAL (use compat wrapper in non-critical flows first)
